The Chromebook challenge is a new trend, where students try to shove a graphite pencil lead up a chromebook charging port. They do this in order to break the chromebook. But there are many flaws with the reprocussions that follow the bad behavior. For one thing, when turning in the chromebook to the school, they will inspect the damage done to the chromebook, and the chromebook insurrance policy does not protect it from intentional damage, so the student will have to end up paying the full price to repay the chromebook.
The other thing that is a reprocussion is damaging school property, or just anyone elses property is bad to damage, and it is morally wrong. The thoughts that go through a students head, to be like, "Ya, I am going to do this really popular trend, it will be funny just watch!" Yet in reality, only bad news will follow from damaging school property. There could also be a legal charge being pressed on the student, because of damaging property that is not theirs. Just all in all, the chromebook challenge is a really stupid internet trend, where students have bad behavior, in which they destroy schools property, without thinking.

In the 100 men vs 1 gorilla scenario, logically, 100 men could win. Being that there a a lot of really strong men in the world, and that 1 gorilla is strong on its own, a gorilla can only lift so much, and has a certain amount of energy. Since there is a lot of men, they can take turns holding back the gorilla while others thry to defeat the gorilla. Eventually the gorilla will tire out, and the men will have energy to keep going. So in reality it would be a very unfair fight.

Greetings, Mr. Rodriguez,

I wanted to let you know how much I have apprecitated your time you have devoted to us students in your classes and field trips. It really means a lot to me, to have the hard work we do, then going into field trips is just a rewarding experience. I wanted to thank you for allowing me to take two axolotls home to the fish tank that I had pepared for them. You have given me a fun experience as a high school senior. And I want to thank you for the knowledge and fun you have given me.

Thank you,
Dylan Walters

I believe that these bans on phones in school in Florida is detrimental to students. For instance, students need to engage with each other, and communicate beyond just in person ways. Getting use out of a phone can be good for a student, or group of students, by communicating and sharing thoughts and ideas to each other, and overall enjoy time with other students outside of class. Students might be defiant about not being alowed to use phones, and end up having a harmful mental separation from their phone.
     Phones also can act as a form of safety, providing quick communication about events or things that happen throughout the day. If implemented in my school, I would most likely continue to carry my phone, but never pull it out throughout the day. I would keep it with me, to continue to maintain my safety, in case there is a problem and I can alert people as to what is happening.

AI can help a student study, by giving the student as much study time as the student wants. This can be good if the teacher can't make it to tutoring, or if the teacher doesn't give out great study material. The AI can also efficiently find and use examples from previous year STAAR tests, or AP tests for that matter. The AI can further develop and ask questions to the student, and give detailed answers, aiding the student further in studying.
     AI can also learn from what the student gets right and what the student gets wrong, faster than a teacher or tutor can achieve. The AI would also give answers or questions faster than a person can think or speak, further perfecting the time efficiency of studying. The AI can also give responses that the student can understaand better than high difficulty vocabulary a tutor or teacher may have. Thus further developing the students vocabulary, making it better as time goes on with the tutoring.

The most stressful part of school for me right now is my class Biology AP. This class has so many field trips, and don't get me wrong, I love the field trips, but when they take out so much of your time in school it gets to be a lot. Not to mention that class has a lot of labs and work that we do, and it can be a motherload at some points. But I do like the class, esspecially since I have my friends in it with me. So this week on Wednesday, some of the students including me are going on a 3 day field trip out camping at Mckinney Roughs nature park. There will be lots to do, but I know I will have a lot of work to do when I get back to school the next week.

The role of social media has greatly improved the engagment in the NCAA, this is helpful in a lot of ways, broadcasting, sports announcers thoughts, and news aiding in the popularity of the sport. Streaming services have greatly improved the population of people's connectivity to the sport, with adds or no adds, while watching the sport. The way that technology has been shaping sport's telecomunication is yet complete.
          The Idea of AI incorporating into how the sports plays will go, is a new technology that is constantly growing everyday. AI can help to interpret which players will make baskets with ease, and others who will struggle. It can also interpret which team will end up on top of all the others. But it's not 100 percent perfect yet, as the AI will continue to learn and analyze how players play in games, and coordinate with their team members.

I used my laptop a lot this spring break, I played games, such as Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption, Immortals Fenyx Rising, and Avatar Frontiers of Pandora. I used a TV to display movies and videos in the living room. I used a desktop computer to run those movies and videos. I even used a Nintendo 3ds to play some games that I haven't played in years. My laptop was also used for some game design in Unreal Engine 5.
          With all this in mind, I spent most of my spring break either watching movies or videos, or playing games or doing game design. And I have been able to integrate the technology I use for game design at home, with the aid of my laptop, Since it is very portable in nature, and is quite powerful, I am successfully able to transport it and allocate my time towards game design.

Technologuy can bridge language gaps while maintaining professionalism by enhancing communitcation with two people with diffferent languages. For example, the invention of the subtitle glasses, can aid in language barriers for a deaf person, or changing the translation to another language, and someone can understand what the other person is saying. This does have limitations though, since the glasses only display what the microphone picks up, and if only one person has the glasses, then there is a language barrier.
           The other option for aiding in the removal of language barriers would be a translator with a ear piece, and a microphone, to speak to the person so that they can get realish time responses to the other person with the language barrier. Though this has downsides, since you have to have a third person that knows both languages, which can be quite extensive, not many people in the world are proficient or want to be a translator for special occasions.

The most interesting thing I learned this week was in a youtube video, the video was a course tutorial on making an RPG game in Unreal Engine 5. I followed the tutorial, and ended up creating a locomotion system for my character in a game project I am making, and what I learned from it was how to set up animations properly in the animation graph, to create a seemingly fluid sequence of animations. I found it interesting, because that is what I want to do for a proffession, and also that just setting up simple animations for a character for a game is very time consuming, but the output is very nice.

An application for the NFL would include path tracing, where a computer algorithm would run plays done by players. This would be more effiecient than constantly trying to come up with a new strategey to make plays in a football game. The application would also include a data structure sorting the plays that worked great, plays that work okay, and plays that didn't work at all. The algorithm and data structure would work great together, since the algorithm could calculate a play that would work, and plays that would not work. While the data structure sorts the algorithms that were previously run, giving a list of plays that worked or didn't work.
          A type of dashboard I would include in the application would be a dropdown that could separate and sort different types of plays that were made throughout the years of NFL games. The idea of a graph could show the success rates of different plays in an NFL game. The graph and the dashboard would work really well together, beacause it could bring together different views on how games can be played or run. With these four features listed, NFL games could become more interesting or tributes to legacy players and plays that were made in different NFL games.

Computers can increase aviation safety by making sure that some sort of aircraft stays within the original path or trajectory that was initially described to the pilot. If a automation such as AI in Aviation is used the entire time a flight is being commensed, then the comuputercan compute based on coordinates, whether another aircraft is coming to close. Using AI can also impoact the fuel and total travel time an aircraft has to get from one destination to the other.
human-Computer Interaction (HCI) could also be a combined conflict in the Aviation industry. there may be a point where a Human has to take over the aircraft, but if the computer could detect that the aircraft is near another one, then the aircraft would prevent the human from taking the aircraft off course. Just as long as the aircraft stays on course and is calculated to not have any interferance with other aircrafts, then Aviation should be much safer.

I think that the govt impacts technology workers and users by choosing what is aloowed in the country. For instance hte Tik Tok ban caused many jobs to be lost, and users to be infuriated. Tik Tok probably addresses these issues by doing workarounds. The feature I would implement would be that no one not even the company has access to your profile's content, Making your profile only accessible to you. The lessons I can take from the Tik Tok ban is that if you are going to make an application, User privacy is very important to make sure it is enforced.
These ideas are common knowledge that if you are going to make an application that would take an email to sign up, you need to make sure that the user's privacy is top tier. Cyber security is a topic we can relate this topic to, since Cyber security is making sure that people are kept safe and that their privacy is kept in line. This is what Tik Tok should have related to with their user's privacy.

AI is contantly evolving each day, and with AI interacting with computer science jobs, it can be unsettling. Although this AI scares some people, it can be benificial too. For example, if someone is working in the game design industry, AI can help with generating 3D models, and applying the texture on them too. This in turn saves a lot of time when developing a project, it can also be really useful for indie developers. But there is a downside for some jobs in the tech world, like low level coding, this is an industry that has been taken over by AI, but at the same time it has been aiding in the overall effieciency at which tasks are completed. But for me, preparing for a job position in the game designer world, I believe it would be very useful to have learned how to use AI for the reason mentioned previously. Although AI aids in developing code, that doesn't mean that going to school for whatever profession you choose won't help you... Because it will.

I most enjoyed making and designing games in my 3 periods 3-4-5, it really has sparked my love and passion for making games.
I would like to just continue creating and designing projects with Unreal Engine 5, it just makes me so happy to do so.
I may be interested in a Unity certification. but I am MOST CERTAINLY desiring to obtain an Unreal Engine 5 Certification.

The term 'brain rot' to me means that you wen out looking for the 'brain rotting stuf' in digital media. It is only brain rot if you don't limit yourself or if you don't restrict yourself in what you watch. I believe it can have a negative impact on your mental health if you don't care about what you are watching or investing your time into. I have never used the term 'slop' but I have used the term 'lore' from which I obtained knowledge of this word from watching wholesome not inapropriate youtubers play minecraft and making a story out of what they achieve in the game. So since I want to be a game developer, I would like for there to be lore in parts of a game I will eventually create. I do believe it is possible to balance meaningful engagement and brain rot, such as with an appropriate amount of time watching both, for example watching a gameplay with some content creator having commentary while playing can be fun and enjoyable, or if like in my family not every night, but some, we all sit downstairs at the tv and watch some funny memes, they can be brain rotting, but it's good not to over-indulge on any sort of media, for it could turn into an obsession. But in order to achieve balance between the two, there has to be a boundry and restraint when indulging in watching any sort of media.

AI that creates 3D Models is getting really good, what it does is take an AI generated image and transforms it into a 3D Model. The quality is really good, with polygons that are almost perfectly put together. The AI then has the option to include the models texture, (It comes from the image). and it will put the texture on the 3D Model pretty much perfectly. This AI is a game changer for the world of 3D Artists, 3D Environment Artist, VFX Teams, and Game Designers. This speeds up the time to come up with, model and texture something for a creator's work. The AI could possibly interfere with copyright issuses, such as creating something that is already out in the world. For me, wanting to become a Game Designer / Developer, this AI really improves the productivity and efficiency of work on projects. What concerns me about this technology, is that a person who is learning how to 3D Model might not be looked after inthe future, since this AI is gettiung so good and can replace a 3D Model Artist's job.

Technology has launched us into a super advanced society. 100 to 200 years ago, farmers had to harvest by hand, which was grueling and tedious hours of work a day. With this yeild from a day's work, could feed just around an immediate families worth of food. This would in turn change in the 1900s to the 2000s. A farmer in the 2000s can produce enough food for 155 to 169 people in a year. This is due to the huge advancements in modern technology, which has improved the yeild of crops per year. Technology is not just at the farmn, but on roads, for there are millions of 18 wheeler trucks that are constantly on the road to deliver food from farms to stores. The use of huge vehicles like that, has decreased the amount of time it takes to get the same amount of food to stores years ago. Some of these big trucks actually have cooling systems inside the cargo area, making it possible to travel on the road longer than before with foods. Technology has vastly improved the amount of food that is produced in a year, making it possible for the human population to be as large as it is.

The 2025 CES event in Las Vegas, will showcase new technology that is soon to come out to the public, or is in a prototype stage. This Tech event is not just limited to computers, but cars and all sorts of things. They even dream of showcasing tech that can improve the climate in the future. It is a enormous gathering that tens of thousands of people go to, and showcase their own technological innovations. If there is a competition at the event, then people coul dhave better track of which values go where.
Technology can enhance this event, for things such as finding your way around the place. But tech can enhance the clarity of microphone audio, in order to give clearer sounds for an overall better and easier experience. Technology is able to help organize the gathering, and better fufil the time that people spend there. Technology can provide better communication at an event like this, and improve the security at the gathering.

Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online?
It is important to protect personal and sensitive info, when publishin gonline, because people can steal you information, and they can steal your identity.
What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?
Steps I can take to keep my personal info safe, is to not put my address or personal infor like social security number, etc, never put these things online.
Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?
I had an old email, and I did a survey online, and it asked personal stuff, when I started getting spam emails all the time, I learned never to do that again.
How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?
At most I would say my name like on a profile, but never share addresses, financial things, or anything else personal, except what is required to complete the task, THAT IS NOT A SCAM.

Coding and technology impacts the Election process on a large scale. Berfore the world have electronic voting machines, every ballot had to be hand checked, (not evaluate by a machine). Needless to say, the world's election systems are so fast and reliable now, and it has made the election process a whole lot easier than before technology. The downsides of electronic ballot machines is that some poeple that just don't know or are innept in technology, have to still use paper ballots. And with the small chance someone does hack into the sytem to change votes, that would hbe a downside to using technology rather than paper. Cyber Security plays a huge role in this part of securing the software for voters. Lots of code goes into this, to ensure that everything is backed up on servers and has anti hack or jailbreak systems.

AI is a growing technology, that is being used to transform the effectiveness and outcome of jobs. AI gets better and better everyday, helping businesses find ways to solve problems in software, or structure of an overall conpany. AI is beneficial for education, because if a student or techer need help with an idea or don't fully understand something, AI can come through and build answers or reasons for that thought. AI can help with transportation, by giving a better response with mapping out a destination.
AI can be harmful too, in ways that the world is not seemingly preparing for. There has already been AI waiters at a restaraunt, there have been people using AI to pose as someone else. AI also may eventually be able to pull real peoples emails, or personal data off the intrernet. These examples are just a few of what has happened in the real world. A new thing that Tesla has been developing is the AI powered maid robot; the robot cleans the house, cooks for you, and does much more. What if the robot malfunctioned, and leaked all of a person's personal data... Cameras always active, maybe even a microphone captures the audio and visuals of a household. These are things to consider with AI now in our everyday lives, causing our privacy and humanity to be stripped away.

Coding can impprove problem solving skills, because most of the time when coding, you are either trying to create something or solve a problem while coding if it doesn't work.
Coding can help in the industry of finance by building a bigger cognitive ability in your brain, allowing you to complete complex task unlike before.
Coding enhances creaativity by giving you the abilty to make whatever you want in code, like a game or a application that can run complex tasks. Collaboration is enhanced by being able to think outside the box with people once your problem solving abilities are improved. Large game design firms will come together in group projects to make something that is not as limited as one person's brain can make. Even people in the stock market might benefit from this to collaborate and quickely solve problems to make the best amount of money they can.

Game Designer is a collaborator in a collaboration / team or company that create games for entertainment. Most game design degrees require a Bachelor's degree, and knowledge in the coding language C++ as well as knowing how to use game design engines such as Unreal Engine or Unity. Opportunites with this career extend to leadership roles, specializing in a specific area of Game Design, etc. I would absolutely love to become a Game Designer, the role has facinated me for a good long while, and the outcomes can be so diverse in the world of game design.

Life in today's time and age would be extremely difficult to live without computer science. Every day I send messages to my mom over text while at school, or use Unreal Engine 5 for game design; taking a picture uses computer science, mapping where the color of each pixel will be in the image. Life without computer science in my opion would not be as safe, and would also be very boring, because we are now so used to using technology with computer science every day.

Following instructions while coding can really help to make sure you get the right result, curriculum, and to develop good habits while coding.
Precision affects the outcome of coding, by if you made a tiny little mistake and it was not what you are being told to code, it can create an error, or change the code entirely.
If there are missing details in the code, then there could either be a different successful output, or an error that won't run your code.
It is important to develop good habits while coding early on, so that you can end up becoming the best possible coder you can be, and to learn to understand the code effieciently.
With these three pieces, we can conclude that making sure you correctly develop code while learning enhances your ability to perform on later coding projects.

A video game that I really enjoy playing is The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. 
I love the fact that the land is so diverse, and there are many different damage type systems.
The Magic system is extremely diverse, and it gives a great feeling when you use magika.
The game is really good about just about anywhere you go, there are friends or foes to encounter.
The game offers a great amount of weaponry, such as maces, swords, axes, warhammers, bows, crossbows, daggers, and even heavy versions of each of those weapons.
There is an extremely diverse skill system, many different types of skills with each one having its own skill tree.
There is amazing voice acting that makes the game flow rather nicely.
There are also a lot of different misc items, and ingredients to craft things.
But best of all, there is always something that will happen when you play that is completely unexpected.
