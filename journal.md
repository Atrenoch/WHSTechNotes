Coding can impprove problem solving skills, because most of the time when coding, you are either trying to create something or solve a problem while coding if it doesn't work.
Coding can help in the industry of finance by building a bigger cognitive ability in your brain, allowing you to complete complex task unlike before.
Coding enhances creaativity by giving you the abilty to make whatever you want in code, like a game or a application that can run complex tasks. Collaboration is enhanced by being able to think outside the box with people once your problem solving abilities are improved. Large game design firms will come together in group projects to make something that is not as limited as one person's brain can make. Even people in the stock market might benefit from this to collaborate and quickely solve problems to make the best amount of money they can.

Game Designer is a collaborator in a collaboration / team or company that create games for entertainment. Most game design degrees require a Bachelor's degree, and knowledge in the coding language C++ as well as knowing how to use game design engines such as Unreal Engine or Unity. Opportunites with this career extend to leadership roles, specializing in a specific area of Game Design, etc. I would absolutely love to become a Game Designer, the role has facinated me for a good long while, and the outcomes can be so diverse in the world of game design.

Life in today's time and age would be extremely difficult to live without computer science. Every day I send messages to my mom over text while at school, or use Unreal Engine 5 for game design; taking a picture uses computer science, mapping where the color of each pixel will be in the image. Life without computer science in my opion would not be as safe, and would also be very boring, because we are now so used to using technology with computer science every day.

Following instructions while coding can really help to make sure you get the right result, curriculum, and to develop good habits while coding.
Precision affects the outcome of coding, by if you made a tiny little mistake and it was not what you are being told to code, it can create an error, or change the code entirely.
If there are missing details in the code, then there could either be a different successful output, or an error that won't run your code.
It is important to develop good habits while coding early on, so that you can end up becoming the best possible coder you can be, and to learn to understand the code effieciently.
With these three pieces, we can conclude that making sure you correctly develop code while learning enhances your ability to perform on later coding projects.

I think that if you could do anything different, it would be to instead of going through 1 person and fixing what they have, explain the whole problem they are facing to the whole class, to minimize the amount of problems if there are any more students that are experiencing the same problem.
I was able to fix everything that you went over, and I'm now 100 percent caught back up.

A video game that I really enjoy playing is The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. 
I love the fact that the land is so diverse, and there are many different damage type systems.
The Magic system is extremely diverse, and it gives a great feeling when you use magika.
The game is really good about just about anywhere you go, there are friends or foes to encounter.
The game offers a great amount of weaponry, such as maces, swords, axes, warhammers, bows, crossbows, daggers, and even heavy versions of each of those weapons.
There is an extremely diverse skill system, many different types of skills with each one having its own skill tree.
There is amazing voice acting that makes the game flow rather nicely.
There are also a lot of different misc items, and ingredients to craft things.
But best of all, there is always something that will happen when you play that is completely unexpected.
