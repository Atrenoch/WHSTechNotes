This is a sample entry.

A video game that I really enjoy playing is The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. 
I love the fact that the land is so diverse, and there are many different damage type systems.
The Magic system is extremely diverse, and it gives a great feeling when you use magika.
The game is really good about just about anywhere you go, there are friends or foes to encounter.
The game offers a great amount of weaponry, such as maces, swords, axes, warhammers, bows, crossbows, daggers, and even heavy versions of each of those weapons.
There is an extremely diverse skill system, many different types of skills with each one having its own skill tree.
There is amazing voice acting that makes the game flow rather nicely.
There are also a lot of different misc items, and ingredients to craft things.
But best of all, there is always something that will happen when you play that is completely unexpected.
